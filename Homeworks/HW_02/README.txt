The red square can be manipulated by moving the white bumper at the bottom of the screen. If the square is hit while the bumper is in motion, the red square’s velocity changes, allowing you to try and aim the red square. If the red square reaches the bottom of the screen or hits the yellow mine, you lose the game. Press enter to restart.
